Was curious to see how the performance of top mining company equities impact the return on copper futures.
Companies chosen are in charge of the the top ten copper mines (by production) globally.
They include Glencore, Freeport, Anglo American, Zijing, Rio Tinto, BHP and First Quantum.
Historically (From Aug 2000 to April 2024), there isn't a very strong relationship between these two variables (typically between 0.45 and 0.5 correlation coefficient)
But Glencore, Freeport and First Quantum tend to have stronger relationships with copper future returns.
In 2024, Glencore (0.56) and Freeport (0.61) have considerably strong positive relationships with copper future returns.
Data was gotten from investing.com, Nasdaq.com and Kaggle.
